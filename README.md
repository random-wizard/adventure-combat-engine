# adventure-combat-engine

Adventure Combat Engine is an easy-to-play fantasy role playing game. The rules attempt to be as concise as possible but still provide a solid foundation to play a fantasy role playing game. Referees and players are encouraged to make additions to the engine as they play to enhance the rules presented in this system.

These rules are inspired by the work of Tom Moldvay who published a rules light game system in the 1980s. The rules presented here are an attempt to put together a similar game system but utilizing a SRD that was not available to Tom back in those days.

Adventure Combat Engine

# Introduction

Adventure Combat Engine is an easy-to-play fantasy role playing game.
The rules attempt to be as concise as possible but still provide a solid
foundation to play a fantasy roleplaying game. Referees and players are
encouraged to make additions to the engine as they play to enhance the
rules presented in this system.

These rules are inspired by the work of Tom Moldvay who published a
rules light game system in the 1980s. The rules presented here are an
attempt to put together a similar game system but utilize the 5.1E SRD
that was released under the Creative Commons license.

# Definitions

d: (dice) The dice that need to be rolled for a certain action or effect
are written in shorthand; 1d6 means roll 1 six sided dice, 2d10 means
roll 2 ten sided dice and add the totals together, 2d6+6 means roll 2
six sided dice and add the totals together and then add six.

XP: (Experience Points) gives the
minimum number of experience points needed to reach a particular
level of profession. Experience points are usually awarded for
surviving dangerous encounters, defeating monsters, recovering
treasure, and learning information that furthers any character
mission.

LVL: (Level) approximation of how powerful the character
has become. It is also an indication to the GM what kind of
adventures are appropriate for the characters, Because of space
restrictions only 10 levels were given for each profession, but higher
levels are possible

HP: (Hit Points) represent a combination of physical and mental
durability, the will to live, and a little bit of luck. Creatures with
more HP are more difficult to kill. A creature reduced to 0 HP is
unconcious. A creature reduced to -10 HP is dead. 

Armor Class (AC): the defensive capability of a character or creature.
The number represents what is needed for an opponent to make a
successful strike on the target with a 1d20 roll.

BAB: (Basic Attack Bonus) the bonus a character or creature adds to
their 1d20 roll when attempting to make a hit on an opponent.

ATK: (Attack) the number of attacks per round the
character can make. Note that 3/2 means the character gets two
attacks on the initial round of combat, then one attack, then two
attacks, and so on

DMG: (Damage) how much damage something does. This is usually written
out in shorthand in various amounds of dice; 1d6, 2d8, 3d6, etc...

INI: (Initiative) to determine who goes first in combat, each side rolls
a 1d6 and the side with the highest roll goes first.

LUCK: (Luck) Situations often arise in an adventure where a character's,
luck becomes crucial. The character must roll a 20 on a 1d20 to avoid
danger. The LUCK score is added to character's roll.

MV: (Movement) How many feet a creature or character can move in one
round.

GP: (Gold Piece) The basic unit of currency in the fantasy world. A
table of equipment will list the cost of things in gold pieces.

SP: (Silver Piece) Ten silver pieces are equal to one gold piece.

ML: (Morale) Creatures may run away or surrender in combat. Morale is
checked in critical situations. The referee rolls 2d6 and if the result
is higher than a creatures morale score, the creature will attempt to
flee.

RCT: (Reaction) CHA modifier is added to 2d6 roll to determine a
creatures reaction.

| 2d6  | Reaction             |
|------|----------------------|
| 2    | Enemy                | 
| 3-5  | Wary (Reroll -4)     |
| 6-8  | Uncertain (Reroll)   |
| 9-11 | Curious (Reroll +4)  |
| 12   | Friend               |

On reroll, wait one round and consider the situation and ongoing
negotiation and actions. After 3 rounds, if the reaction is not Enemies
or Friends, the creatures will attempt to withdraw from the situation.


# Character Ability Scores

Characters have six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Generate these scores by rolling
2d6 + 6 (2-12 and add 6) nine times. Choose the best six
rolls and assign them to any ability scores. Characters are heroes, not
average individuals.

Strength (STR): measures bodily power, athletic training, and raw
physical force. 

Dexterity (DEX): measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

Constitution (CON): measures health, stamina, and life force. 

Intelligence (INT): measures mental acuity, recollection, and
ability to reason. 

Wisdom (WIS): measures intuition, perception, and subconcious
intelligence.

Charisma (CHA):  measures eloquence, charm, and personality.

The six ability scores can modify various roll checks and secondary
scores of the game.

Ability Score Modifier Table

Score     | Modifier |
----------|----------|
 3        | -3       |
 4-5      | -2       |
 6-8      | -1       |
 9-12     | 0        |
 13-15    | +1       |
 16-17    | +2       |
 18       | +3       |

Add STR modifier to BAB.
Add STR modifier to DMG.
Add DEX modifier * 5% to thief skill rolls.
Add DEX modifier to AC.
Add DEX modifier to INI.
Add CON modifier to HP.
Add CON modifier to cheating death.
Add WIS modifier to LUCK rolls.
Add CHA modifier to reaction rolls.


Cheating Death: CON modifier is used to determine how far below 0 HP the
character can go and still be unconscious but alive. Thus, a character
with an 18 CON (+3) could go to -13 HP and still live instead of -10 LP.

HP: CON modifier is added to a character's hit point total. The modifier
is also added each time the character goes up a level

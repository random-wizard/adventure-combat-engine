Adventure Combat Engine

# Introduction

Adventure Combat Engine is an easy-to-play fantasy role playing game.
The rules attempt to be as concise as possible but still provide a solid
foundation to play a fantasy role playing game. Referees and players are
encouraged to make additions to the engine as they play to enhance the
rules presented in this system.

These rules are inspired by the work of Tom Moldvay who published a
rules light game system in the 1980s. The rules presented here are an
attempt to put together a similar game system but utilizing a SRD that
was not available to Tom back in those days.

# Definitions

**d:** (dice) The dice that need to be rolled for a certain action or
effect are written in shorthand; 1d6 means roll 1 six sided dice, 2d10
means roll 2 ten sided dice and add the totals together, 2d6+6 means
roll 2 six sided dice and add the totals together and then add six.

**XP:** (Experience Points) Represents how much experience the
profession has accrued. The referee awards experience points for
defeating creatures, finding treasure, and other actions that accomplish
the goals of the group.

**LVL:** (Level) Represents the power of a character. Professions grant
more powers, spells, hit points and other benefits with each level a
character acquires. The referee can use a character's level as a guide
to how dangerous of an adventure they can handle.

**HP:** (Hit Points) Represent a combination of physical and mental
durability, the will to live, and a little bit of luck. Creatures with
more HP are more difficult to kill. A creature reduced to 0 HP is
unconcious. A creature reduced to -10 HP is dead. 

**AC:** (Armor Class) The defensive capability of a character or
creature. The number represents what is needed for an opponent to make a
successful strike on the target with a 1d20 roll.

**BAB:** (Basic Attack Bonus) The bonus a character or creature adds to
their 1d20 roll when attempting to make a hit on an opponent.

**ATK:** (Attack) The number of attacks per round the character can
make. Note that 3/2 means the character gets two attacks on the initial
round of combat, then one attack, then two attacks, and so on

**DMG:** (Damage) How much damage something does. This is usually
written out in shorthand in various amounds of dice; 1d6, 2d8, 3d6,
etc...

**INI:** (Initiative) Used to determine who goes first in combat, each
side rolls a 1d6 and the side with the highest roll goes first.

**LUCK:** (Luck) Situations often arise in an adventure where a
character's, luck becomes crucial. The character must roll a 20 on a
1d20 to avoid danger. The luck score is added to character's roll.

**MV:** (Movement) How many feet a creature or character can move in one
round.

**GP:** (Gold Piece) The basic unit of currency in the fantasy world. A
table of equipment will list the cost of things in gold pieces.

**SP:** (Silver Piece) Ten silver pieces are equal to one gold piece.

**ML:** (Morale) Creatures may run away or surrender in combat. Morale
is checked in critical situations. The referee rolls 2d6 and if the
result is higher than a creatures morale score, the creature will
attempt to flee.

**RCT:** (Reaction) A 2d6 roll used by the referee to determine a
creature's reaction.

| 2d6   | Reaction             |
|-------|----------------------|
|  2-3  | Enemy                | 
|  4-5  | Wary (Reroll -4)     |
|  6-8  | Uncertain (Reroll)   |
|  9-10 | Curious (Reroll +4)  |
| 11-12 | Friend               |

On reroll, wait one round and consider the situation; any ongoing
negotiation, friendly or threatening actions. After 3 rounds, if the
reaction is not Enemies or Friends, the creatures will attempt to
withdraw from the situation.

# Character Ability Scores

Characters have six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Generate these scores by rolling
2d6 + 6 (2-12 and add 6) nine times. Choose the best six
rolls and assign them to any ability scores. Characters are heroes, not
average individuals.

**STR:** (Strength) Measures bodily power, athletic training, and raw
physical force. 

**DEX:** (Dexterity) Measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

**CON:** (Constitution) Measures health, stamina, and life force. 

**INT:** (Intelligence) Measures mental acuity, recollection, and
ability to reason. 

**WIS:** (Wisdom) Measures intuition, perception, and subconcious
intelligence.

**CHA:** (Charisma) Measures eloquence, charm, and personality.

The six ability scores can modify various roll checks and secondary
scores of the game.

Ability Score Modifier Table

|Score     | Modifier |
|----------|----------|
| 3        | -3       |
| 4-5      | -2       |
| 6-8      | -1       |
| 9-12     | 0        |
| 13-15    | +1       |
| 16-17    | +2       |

- Add DEX modifier to AC.
- Add DEX modifier to INI.

Notes

Cheating Death: CON modifier is used to determine how far below 0 HP the
character can go and still be unconscious but alive. Thus, a character
with an 18 CON (+3) could go to -13 HP and still live instead of -10 LP.

HP: CON modifier is added to a character's hit point total. The modifier
is also added each time the character goes up a level

Skill: This gives the basic chance for the rogue to use various thief
like skills; lockpicking, finding and removing traps, pickpocketing,
etc... the following two skills use a different progression based on the
following formulas.

- Climb Walls = 85% + (1% * LVL)
- Hear Noise = 10% + (2% * LVL)

# Character Races

Note on ability scores. Each race gets a modifier to ability scores. If
a bonus would put the score above 18, then the player has to put the
bonus in a different stat of their choosing. If a penalty would put the
score below 3, then the player has to put the penalty in a different
stat of their choosing.

Consider all profession restrictions to be guidelines. If the referee 
and players decide that a Dwarf has discovered how to be a Mage, and
that would make an interesting campaign, then go for it.

## Humans

Usually, the most common encountered creature in the fantasy world.
Humans are around 5'10" tall. They can be any profession. They can add 1
point to any ability score they choose.

## Dwarves

Stocky and muscular, dwarves live in complex tunnels built under
mountains. Dwarves are around 4'6" tall. Dwarves are renown blacksmiths,
stone masons, and gem crafting. Dwarves can only be warriors. They gain
1 point of STR, and 1 point of CON, but lose 1 point of DEX and 1 point
of CHA.

stonework or metallurgy. Their base chance to detect is 50% + 3% per
LVL.

Dwarves get a +1 to BAB rolls when using an ax or a hammer.

## Elves

Elves are slender human like beings with pointy ears. Elves are around
5' 6" tall. They have a natural affinity for the forest. Elves are
renown for woodworking. Elves can be any profession. They gain 1 point

ground then below. Gnomes are renown for tinkering and their friendly,
child like demeanor. Gnomes can be any profession. They gain 1 point in
CHA, but lose 1 point of WIS.

their LVL even if they are not a rogue.

Halfings can not use large two handed weapons such as a battle ax or a
two handed sword. Halflings get a +1 to BAB rolls when using a sling.

# Multiple Professions

A character may choose to level up in two professions at the same time,
limited to combinations based on which race they are.

| Race     | Profession     |
|----------|----------------|
| Humans   | Warrior/Priest |
| Gnome    | Mirager/Rogue  |
| Halfling | Warrior/Rogue  |
| Elf      | Warrior/Mage   |

The character combines the total number of XP for both classes to reach
each LVL. The HP are the average between the two professions, rounded
up. The character is allowed to use the least restrictive weapons and
armor of the two professions, and gains the higher BAB and LUCK of the
two professions.

For example; a Warrior/Priest would begin their career with 8 HP and
would need 3500 XP to reach LVL 2 (2000 from the Warrior and 1500 from
the Pirest profession). Their BAB would be 0. Their LUCK would be +4
since the Priest LUCK of +4 is higher than the Warrior LUCK of +2. The
Warrior Priest could use any armor and any weapon since the Warrior
has no restrictions.

At the referee's discretion, other profession combinations can be
allowed. For example, In a particular campaign, Elves may have mastered
all magic and can be a Mage/Priests.

# Monster Statistics

Short hand abbreviations are used to list out creatures abilities and
statistics. For example, a typical statistic block for a Hill Giant

Hill Giant (#:1, AC:14, HP:24, INI:0, BAB:+2, ATK:1 giant club,
DMG:2d6, ML:7, LUCK:+6, MV:90', XP:210)

In general, a creatures BAB, LUCK, and XP award will be based off HP.
Feel free to adjust the numbers when making up your own opponents. For
example, perhaps a hill giant is particularly clumsy and only has a +2
BAB instead of +5. Since the hill giant is a little weaker, the referee
decides to reduce the XP by 40.

| HP      | BAB         | LUCK | XP    |
